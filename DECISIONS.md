# DECISIONS

These are the assumptions and judgment calls I made while building the app on my own. Newest decisions are at the bottom of each section.

## Stack and project
- **Vite 6 + React 19 + TypeScript 5.8 + Vitest 3.** These are well-known, stable major versions. Even newer majors exist on npm, but I pinned to versions I could validate.
- **No UI or CSS library.** Styling is one hand-written `styles.css` using CSS variables and logical properties for RTL.
- **App name:** "כוחות" ("Kochot", the Hebrew slang for picking teams). The package name is `kochot`.
- **`base: './'`** in `vite.config.ts`, so the same build works at a domain root (Netlify/Vercel) and at a sub-path (GitHub Pages).

## Balancing engine
- **Cost compares per-player averages, not raw sums.** This makes odd splits (6 vs 5) comparable. It is mathematically the same as giving the short team one "average" phantom player. With equal sizes it is identical to comparing sums. The bigger team gets no extra compensation for having more players.
- **Teams are compared on the mean absolute deviation from the group average** (summed over teams), not max−min. For 2 teams this is exactly the gap between them. For 3+ teams it is smoother for local search.
- **Balance cost is in "rating points":** Σ weight × deviation / Σ weights. Penalties use the same unit.
- **Goalkeeping counts the team's best keeper, not the sum.** Only one player stands in goal. Declared goalkeepers ("can play GK") take priority when picking that best keeper.
- **Goalkeeper and leader rules use one formula:** penalize every team that lacks one, beyond what is unavoidable. With enough keepers, every team gets one. With fewer keepers than teams, keepers are not stacked on one team.
- **Penalty values** (rating points): missing GK = 2, missing leader = 1, each violated keep-together/apart pair = 10, size deviation = 50 per player. All of these dominate any realistic balance gap (typically 0.05–0.6), so the penalties act as near-hard constraints but still give a best-effort answer when they cannot be met. Penalty values are not editable in the UI, to keep settings simple.
- **"Leader" means leadership ≥ 7 by default.** The threshold can be changed in settings.
- **Exhaustive search covers 2 teams with ≤ 14 players.** With equal sizes, player 0 is fixed to team 0, so 14 players means C(13,6) = 1716 splits, which takes a few ms. Everything else uses local search: alternating noisy snake-draft and random starts, then first-improvement swap hill-climbing. It stops after 250 ms or 2000 restarts, whichever comes first.
- **Swaps only, no single-player moves**, so team sizes always equal the target sizes.
- **Pool for re-rolls:** every evaluated neighbor is offered to a bounded pool of the 40 best distinct partitions. Partitions are deduplicated by canonical relabeling.
- **Re-roll picks from near-optimal candidates:** pool entries within `max(0.15, 40% of best)` of the best. If that gives fewer than 3, it widens to the top 3, but never beyond +0.5. That cap is below every penalty, so a re-roll never breaks a GK/leader/constraint rule. Splits already shown are excluded until all candidates have been seen.
- **"Generate" always returns the best split.** "Re-roll" is how you get variety. Re-roll samples from the cached pool (instant) and keeps a history so you don't keep seeing the same teams.
- **Score shown to users:** `100 · exp(−0.5 · cost)`. A typical well-balanced split scores 80–95. A missing goalkeeper drops it into the 30s, and a broken constraint drops it to nearly 0.
- **Out-of-range ratings** (missing or NaN) are clamped to 1–10, with 5 as the default.
